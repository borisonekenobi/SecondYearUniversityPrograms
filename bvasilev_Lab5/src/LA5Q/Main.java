/**
 * Requirements:
 * The application will offer 2 modes, a tutorial and game
 *  - Tutorial: walks the user through the processing of a single flight
 *  - Game: offers the user the full functionality of the game
 * The application will generate random flights.
 * Each flight will have a random list of passengers
 *  - Specifications
 *     - The list of passengers should mimic the count of passengers in a real plane
 *     - The passengers should have realistic names
 *     - The generated ticket numbers should have 13 digits
 *     - Every ticket number should also be unique
 * The application will maintain a list of flights.
 *  - Specifications
 *     - Every flight destination should be to a well-known airport
 *     - The application should be able to maintain 50 airports
 *     - One of these, should always be the source airport (to mimic flights leaving from an airport)
 * Each flight will have one of the following states:
 * 	- Ready to be boarded
 * 	- Ready to depart
 * 	- In Flight
 * 	- Ready to be disembarked
 * 	- Specifications
 * 	   - The states should follow this order:
 * 	      - Ready to be boarded -> ready to depart -> in flight -> ready to be disembarked
 * The application will allow the user to select a flight.
 *  - Specifications
 *     - The selection will be made by entering a flight number
 *     - The user should be able to enter any number of spaces between the flight designator and flight number
 * Each passenger will have the following states:
 *   - Checked-in
 *   - Boarded
 *   - Disembarked
 *   - Specifications
 * 	    - The states should follow this order:
 *         - Checked-in -> boarded -> disembarked
 * Once a flight is selected for boarding, the application will:
 *  - board all passengers onto the plane
 *  - print a seating chart
 *  - Specifications
 *     - The seating chart should resemble a real seating chart with aisles in-between
 *     - Every occupied seat should be printed in green
 *     - Every unoccupied seat should be printed in white
 *     - A legend should also be printed to help the user understand
 * Once a flight is selected for disembarking, the application will:
 *  - print a queue of all disembarked passengers starting from the front row and going through all rows consecutively
 *  - the passengers from a particular row will disembark in a random order
 *  - Specifications
 *     - For every passenger, their name, seat and ticket number will be printed
 * ðŸ™‚
